This adapter keeps the filesystem completely in memory. This is useful
when you need a filesystem, but donâ€™t want it persisted. It can be done
by using the `League\Flysystem\InMemory\InMemoryFilesystemAdapter`.

This adapter can be used in tests as a test double and removes much of
the need to mock your Flysystem dependency.

## Installation:

```bash
composer require league/flysystem-memory:^3.0
```

## Usage:

```php
// The internal adapter
$adapter = new League\Flysystem\InMemory\InMemoryFilesystemAdapter();

// The FilesystemOperator
$filesystem = new League\Flysystem\Filesystem($adapter);
```
